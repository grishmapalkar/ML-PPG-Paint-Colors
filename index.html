## About Me

I'm Arnab, a math grad student at the University of Pittsburgh, researching computational neuroscience with Dr. Bard Ermentrout. I specialized in pure mathematics during my MSc at IISER Bhopal, focusing on Algebra and Number Theory. Currently, I'm diving into data science and machine learning at CMU with Dr. Robert Kass. With experience teaching at several institutions, I've honed my teamwork and leadership skills. I pride myself on patiently teaching calculus to students and expertly deboning Bengali fish dishes.

## Projects:
### Can median house value be predicted based on population characteristics?
[Poster Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/fall2022/600files/poster4.pdf))

It was a poster presentation in a group and it was my applied first project. I did the data cleaning and visualization using tidyverse, Dplyr, and GGPlot hist and Corrplot. We tried to visualize the data to get an idea of how the cost of a house(dependent variable) depends on other factors e.g. no of bedrooms, the population of the area, vacant units, etc. Motivated from here, I am trying to write a project on California house prices with some predictive modeling.

### Predictive Maintenance: FPolisolution
[Project directory]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://github.com/Arnabds/FPoliSolutions-Predictive-Maintenance))

This project was all about predicting when a machine is going to <mark>fail</mark> from the variable inputs. The main model we used here is logistic regression and we performed SVC at the end. In the general file I have given a general introduction, performed EDA, cluster analysis, introduced different models, analyzed their performance, and made predictions then as a Bonus we touched SVC and Neural Networks briefly.

### My ongoing Ph.D. research project


We are dealing with the population model and spiking model which are related by theta transformation and that is why the model is called by the name as theta model. We have shown the transformation calculation in particular. Then we wanted to find out a particular impulse through which we can jump between higher and lower oscillations. The challenge was that we were dealing with a large population of neurons and that is why we had to start with the case study and bifurcation diagram. We got some ideas and I managed to find good parameters so that the neurons behave as we wanted in 9D then we extended the case to the population of neurons and the system responded correctly. Now we were trying to summarise the result. Theta neuron model has application in visual cortex and also in Parkinson's disease as we noticed delayed beta oscillation in Parkinson which can be studied using theta model.
